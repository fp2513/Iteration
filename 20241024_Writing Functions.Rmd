```{r setup, include=FALSE}

library(rvest)
```

Functions to use when using the same basic code more than two times (iteration)
Functions like mapping in maths (have an input then have a described operation and have an output)

Scoping: if in function there is some variable that you haven't defined then the function will scope your entire R environment to see whether you had previously defined this variable (but generally this is something that you do not want)
want to make sure that everything that you need for the function to work is defined inside the function (since work environemnt can change)
Function should be self contained and is everything that this function needs defined in the function 

Writing a function that is clear is really important
